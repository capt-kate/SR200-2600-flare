<p>The Time-to-Seed (TTS) register records the number of clock cycles taken to collect the set of raw noise bits used by the previous GEN_NOISE command. The raw noise bits are collected from the internal entropy generator. The time taken to collect this raw noise data set is non-deterministic. This register does not include the deterministic cycles taken to process the raw noise data into a seed within the GEN_NOISE command.
The number of raw noise bits collected depends on the current security strength setting and can be either 1024 or 1536 bits.
This register is only used to provide diagnostic performance data. For security reasons, this register is cleared by a zeroized operation.</p>
<p>If the background raw noise collection build-time option is enabled, and there has been sufficient time between GEN_NOISE commands to collect a complete set of background raw noise data, the time taken to execute the GEN_NOISE command becomes deterministic and relatively low.
If there has been insufficient time between GEN_NOISE commands to collect a complete set of raw noise data, or if the build-time optional background noise collection logic has not been included, the time taken to execute a GEN_NOISE command becomes non-deterministic (possibly measured in terms of milliseconds) because this process includes the non-deterministic collection of raw noise bits.
In both cases, the value in the TTS reflects only the time the core takes to generate the raw noise. When there is no background-collected noise, the time taken to run the GEN_NOISE command includes the cycle measure in the TTS. When there is background noise available, GEN_NOISE runs much more quickly and takes much less time than the cycles measured in TTS - because they were collected in the background.</p>
<p>Deterministic cycles in a GEN_NOISE command that should be added on top of the non-deterministic time specified by TTS.
--- Derivation Function (varies depending on the build-time configured datapath size of the AES core and the run-time chosen security strength):
------ 128-bit datapath AES, 128-bit security strength: 350 Cycles
------ 128-bit datapath AES, 256-bit security strength: 520 Cycles
------ 32-bit datapath AES, 128-bit security strength: 1230 Cycles
------ 32-bit datapath AES, 256-bit security strength: 1850 Cycles
--- Health Test:
------ Background Noise Collection Build-Time option is OFF: ~300-1000 cycles
------ Background Noise Collection Build-Time option is ON: 0 cycles
--- Others:
------ Less than ~50 cycles.</p>
